# What I like about my implementation

* The conde is well separated in different components
* I used the item id to dinamically change the color to have some variety

# What I would improve

* Make it so that it works like an actual UI library, that builds the UI dinamically using CSS Flex or Grid layout, instead of relying on absolute positions calculated based on days elapsed

* Add individual days on the timeline header

* Put it on line on Vercel or some other similar deployment option

* properly test the app with some unit tests to guarantee that it is rendered when there are no itens and when there are many itens
